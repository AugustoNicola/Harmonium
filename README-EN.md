Harmonium is a simple web app to help people learn musical concepts in a more entertaining way. It virtually simulates a piano capable of playing chords and scales in order to understand how they are constructed, as well as playing the notes. The built-in selectors allow for choosing between a wide range of common chords and scales, and there are also other useful features, such as inverting chords.
